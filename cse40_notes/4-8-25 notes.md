Machines don't learn. They find a mathematical formula, which applied to a collection of inputs ("training data") produces our desired outputs.
    - ML is a universally recognized term that refers to the science/engineering of building machines that can do various useful things without being explicitly programmed to do so.

ML Algorithms:
    Supervised Learning
        - Uses labeled examples of classes (types of things) to construct a classifier (model) that can make predictions about future objects.
    Unsupervised Learning
        - Organiz[es/Analyzes unlabeled observations to identify new categories/clusters
    Reinforcement Learning
        - Uses delayed feedback about actions performed in some environments to learn the value of actions taken in specific contexts.]

Different kinds of supervised ML:
Classification: Output one of a set of discrete labels
Regression: output a real number
Clustering: outputs groups of similar data points
